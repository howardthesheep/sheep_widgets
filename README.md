Sheep Widgets is a group of custom widgets I find myself using repetitively
throughout the development process across multiple projects. The idea is to create a central repository
for these widgets to maximize code reuse and readability.

## Features

This package currently has two main features:
- Widgets
- Validators

Widgets are reusable components from various projects that I've added to this central repository.
The validators are data input validators used for error checking inputs in the various reusable form fields I've created
such as EmailInput or PhoneInput.

## Getting started
Install the package by adding the following code to your `pubspec.yaml` 
`sheep_widgets: ^0.0.1`

Then run the command to download these dependencies:
`flutter pub get`
